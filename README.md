# Plotters Devloper's Guide Examples

Examples from [Plotter Developer's Guide](https://plotters-rs.github.io/book/intro/introduction.html).
The sturcture of the code in src/main.rs is based on the examples in the book
with the module names tracking the section names in the book.

To run one example, such as `getting_started`, use: `cargo run --example getting_started`.
To run all examples use: `cargo run --example all` or `cargo run` as `fn main` runs all examples.

If you are using an IDE, like vscode that supports displaying
`.png` files, then simply click on the image files to see them.
You can display all the files in a browser with `google-chrome images/*.png`
And, of course, you can use `feh` or `gimp` to view the images.
